    <h2>My Academic Goals!</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>My #1 goal as of right now is to get my Associate's Degree as quick as I can, so I can transfer to a university. My top two right now are UC Irvine and CSU Fullerton! I am a second year student but I have switched majors a lot, so I still have my major classes left to finish. I also am making it a goal for myself to stop procrastinating and not settle for Cs this semester.</li>

    <h2>My Personal Goals!</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>I have many miscellaneous goals. However, I would say that my biggest goals is to get an internship at Riot Games while I am in uni, and eventually work there as a developer -- specifically on the Valorant side. Another goal of mine is to get my license before October ends! Yes, I am 21 with no license. There's too many on the list its hard to just name a few. (╥_╥)</li>
